Hi! I'm Jos√© Luis, an engineer with a variety of interests. In this website, there are links to my coding related adventures.

You can browse, for example, my old Launchpad profile [here](https://launchpad.net/~artirj). Most recently, you can browse my github repo [here](https://github.com/artirj).
